Welcome to Introduction to Python!
In this course, we use Python version 3 (or simply Python 3).
If you'd like more details on previous versions of Python and how version 3 is different than previous versions,
check out the History of Python on Wikipedia. If you're new to Python or programming in general,
this article will make more sense after you complete a lesson or two so you may want to hold off for now.
All you need to know now is that your solution code for the programming exercises in this course will be
graded based on Python 3 code.
